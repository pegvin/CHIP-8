# CHIP-8
A Chip-8 Emulator Written In C

---
## About
this is my first step into low-level stuff, i look forward on building more emulators & once i have some money i want to build a small computer with a 6502 or a z80.

chip-8 is kinda like a "specification" which decribes how a chip-8 machine should work, i am not aware of any "true" chip-8 cpu but it's quite easy to build a emulator of.

## Keymap
i'm using this keymap:

```
1 2 3 C     1 2 3 4
4 5 6 D  >  Q W E R
7 8 9 E  >  A S D F
A 0 B F     Z X C V
```

## Building

make sure you have GNU Make, GCC/Clang & SDL2 Installed, then clone the repo

```
make all -j4
```

you will have a executable named `chip-8`
